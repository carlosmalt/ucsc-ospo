Open source research efforts within the University of California face many challenges, such as:

- Educating students to be productive in open source projects 
- Building policies and infrastructure around the open source research efforts that matter 
- Ensuring high-quality and frequent releases 
- Engaging with developer communities 
- Contributing back to other projects effectively 

Overall, UC campuses need some guidance to start and keep advancing in their OSPO Journey.
