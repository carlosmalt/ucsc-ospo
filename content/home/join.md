[The OSPO UC Santa Cruz Community](#community) is open to all. Sometimes, there are community participants with an established OSPO or similar open source initiative who wish to become a Member.

- Every OSPO UC Santa Cruz Member must agree and sign the charter.

- If youâ€™re interested in joining as Member, please complete the membership application.

- Community participants coming from **entities focused on OSPO-related topics who help OSPOs but may not have an OSPO** can join as [Associates](#associates) .

*Note: The Associate Program is different from a membership and not entitled to membership benefits. To see Associate benefits, please read the documentation.*
