### Hybrid In-Person and Online Event 
#### Registration to open in late August!  
The UC Open Source Research Symposium (successor to the CROSS Research Symposia series) is happy to be able to mix in-person, hybrid and fully remote activities in an effort to provide a larger audience the opportunity to learn about the cutting edge open source research being done throughout the University of California.  Participants can interact with UC faculty, graduate students, and affiliated researchers, and discuss future directions and discover areas of collaboration from campuses throughout the UC system. 

AND returning after a two year hiatus, the Symposium will once again include the annual UC Santa Cruz Systems Research Lab’s Oktoberfest barbeque on the evening of the first day of the symposium.

This year’s event is organized by the [UC Santa Cruz Open Source Program Office](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/) (OSPO) and sponsored by the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) and [CROSS](https://cross.ucsc.edu/). It will include keynote speakers, expert panels, and technical workshops, as well as poster presentations highlighting the work of our Open Source Research Experience students.

#### Cost for non-UC affiliated participants: $299
